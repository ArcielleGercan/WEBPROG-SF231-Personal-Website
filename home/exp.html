<p> I have gained valuable experience in Java, Python, and SQL, which have enabled me to develop applications, automate tasks, and manage databases effectively. These skills have been essential in completing various academic projects and exploring real-world IT solutions.
  In addition, I’ve also learned Flowgorithm, which helped me better understand programming logic through visual flowcharts. I’ve completed several lessons in this language, which further enhanced my understanding of algorithm design. 
  I’m always looking to expand my knowledge and skills in IT.</p>
